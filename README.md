# H2Overlord - Watering the plants on my balcony
## Project Goal
I want to water my plants. On a regular basis (ideally). 
Using a watering can can be troublesome if I'm not at home in the summer. 
Using an existent solution from the hardware store is too easy.
Therefore I want to configure a Raspberry so that  it automatically waters my plants to my liking. 

##  Requirements
I want to water up to 15 plants on my balcony. Each plant needs a different amount of water. 
Each summer I have a different set of plants on my balcony so the system should be reusable!
Watering schedules shall be configured via a simple web frontend. Moreover I want to checkout humidity and temperature on my balcony, even from an remote environment, so that I'm able to increase/decrease the watering accordingly.
I do not have a water connection on my balcony so the water storage should be a) big enough to supply all plants for a certain timeframe and b) easily accessible so that I'm able to disconnect the container to refill it.
Ideally I can also checkout in the web frontend if the water storage needs a refill.

## Materials
- Raspberry Pi 3B+ + necessart power supply
- 12 V Pump (Brand: Runcci-Yun, Model: R896 but any pump with similar specs will do)
- Breadboard
- Relais that is able to handle the 12V Pump 
- Temperature and Humidity sensor GY-BM ME/PM 280
- 12VDC power supply which is able to power the pump 
- a few jumper cables 
- 20l water canister
- water hose and micro drip valves (drip level individually adjustable)
